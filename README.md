## Dashboard

This is just a dummy dashboard. It only shows my projects that are already published on GitHub.

In this project only HTML and CSS are used. I tried to use **'Grid Layout'** as much as possible, as the assignment suggested.

- Under the _My Projects_ part `Live project pages are linked on to each card. `
- On the _Announcements_ part `Twitter 'Tech' List is embedded.` So that, you can check easily the feeds on tech! ðŸŽ‰
